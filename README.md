### Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm Yusuf. I’m a Research Assistant at the Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, where I am part of KnowLab, a research group that focuses on AI in Healthcare.

🔬 Current Research
- I'm working on using Knowledge Graphs and Graph Machine Learning for early diagnosis and of rare neurodegenerative diseases.


📚 Other Research Interests
- 💻 Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction in Medical Imaging: Explored methods for improving chest X-ray analysis by incorporating vision and language models with eye gaze patterns.
- 🧠 User Experience and Assistive Technologies in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Investigated neck collar preferences and user experiences in motor neuron disease through a survey-based study. Explored the suitability of current outcome measures for neck collars in motor neuron disease, contributing to insights published in JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies.
- 📊 Biomedical Knowledge Curation: Worked on a scoping review to explore the applications of knowledge graphs in biomedical and healthcare sciences. Worked on research benchmarking and analyzing in-context learning, fine-tuning, and supervised learning for biomedical knowledge curation, with a focus on chemical entities of biological interest (CHeBI).

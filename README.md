### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Yusuf!

- 🧐 My interests lie at the intersection of health and data science.
- 🔭 I’m currently looking at:
  * 👨🏾‍💻 The use of Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks in rare neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and prognosis. 
  * 📚 A systematic review looking into "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on any of these topics!

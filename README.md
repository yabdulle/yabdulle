### Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm Yusuf. I’m a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, part of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King’s College London.

Current Research
- My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, health informatics, and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, I aim to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and multimodal data to model the onset and progression of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) / Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Yusuf and I'm a Honorary Researcher @ the UCL Institute of Neurology 

- 🧐 I'm interested in the crossover between health and data science as well as education and data science!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on :
  * 🧠 Characteristicing molecular and connnectomic features of ALS and FTD including neurotransmitter profiles
  * 👨🏾‍💻 Classifying patients with FTD using a Graph Neural Network
  * 📚 A systematic review looking into "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"
  * 🏥 Modelling of diagnostic and treatment pathways for diseases
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about geometric deep learning!

### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Yusuf!

- 🧐 My interests lie at the intersection of health and data science, as well as the synergy between education and data science.
- 🔭 I’m currently looking at :
  * 🧠 Characteristicing molecular and connnectomic features of ALS and FTD including neurotransmitter profiles
  * 👨🏾‍💻 Developing Graph Neural Networks for classifying patients with FTD and ALS.
  * 📚 A systematic review looking into "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"
  * 🏥 Modelling of diagnostic and treatment pathways for diseases
- 🌱 I'm constantly learning and currently delving deeper into the field of geometric deep learning.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on any of these topics!
